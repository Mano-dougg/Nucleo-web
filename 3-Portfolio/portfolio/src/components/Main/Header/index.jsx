        Hello

        My name is Jaedson

      <p>
        I am a Digital Product and UI Designer – creating digital experiences
        that are intuitive for real people and making complex processes easy to
        use. <br />
        right now, I am Design Lead at Holiday Extras, covering all our
        digital platforms across a whole load of brands – leading a great team
        across design, UI engineering, accessibility and customer experience.
        I am lucky to be part of a great team of designers, writers, engineers,
        PMs and data specialists – amongst others – testing, iterating and
        optimising our platforms and products.<br />
        I`ve got some work on Dribbble,
        some previous work at Saga and you can find me over on twitter and
        sometimes on Medium too. I also take too many photos.
